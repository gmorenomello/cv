		<h1>Gustavo Borges Moreno e Mello</h1>

		Hi! My name is Gustavo. I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the Oslo Metropolitan University.
		I am the Head of the academic group in Artificial Intelligence at Department of Computer Science and CEO of OsloMet's AI Lab. With a background in neuroscience and psychology, my interest is to use computational methods to better understand how biological and psychological processes may give rise to intelligent behaviors. 
		My main focus is on biologically plausible algorithms for causal inference, associative learning and sense of agency. I have special interest on usign spiking neural networks to solve problems in robotics and data science, explore new policies in reinforcemnt learning by incorporating recent developments in behavior analysis and analysis of timing sensitive data such as video from event cameras, audio and language. 
		The ultimate goal is not only to make an intelligent tool to solve a problem, but to make an artificial intelligence which behaves as the natural intelligence, so it can help to better understand ourselves.
